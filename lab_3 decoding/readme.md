# Lab 3

The results of encryption algorithms were provided in previous submissions.  

### Output for each decryption algorithm based on selected encryption alg

1. Encoded by Caesar cipher
    - Caesar cipher: `koka`
    - Block decoding: `okoy`
    - Stream decoding: `eaeo`

1. Block encoding:
    - Caesar cipher: `okoy`
    - Block decoding: `koka`
    - Stream decoding: `aeaq`

1. Stream encoding:
    - Caesar cipher: `eaeo`
    - Block decoding: `uyuk`
    - Stream decoding: `koka`

### CPU Time

For the first iteration, all algorithms took around 60 - 70 thousand nanosecods. However, subsequent decryptions took significantly less time, with most of them needing 5-10 thousand nanoseconds.
