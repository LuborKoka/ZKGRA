Cipher input: KOKA
Task 1a:

Output: plpz
103287

Algorithm: 
I map each letter in the alphabet to its number (in the correct order). I then map the input to these numbers. In the next step, I subtract the numbers from 27, thus creating the reverse numbering.

Task 1b:

Output: uque
74944

Algorithm:
I start the same way as the previous task - I map the letters in the input to their corresponding numbers. Then, I subtract the order of the letter at which the alphabet blocks are separated (so for instance, if the blocks are separated by the letter 'e', i subtract 5). I add 26 to the numbers that are less or equal to 0 to reverse number 2 blocks in the alphabet.
