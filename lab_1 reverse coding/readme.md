# Lab 1

Submitted on September 23rd, 2024 at 2:59pm to ``nosovka7@ukr.net`` (idk, this is the email that prof. Khylenko gave us).


## Changes in code since submission:

1. functions ``encodeBlock`` and ``encodeStream`` now return a string of encoded characters instead of an array of their numbers.
1. the param `separateAt` of the function ``encodeBlock`` can now be the letter at which the alphabet is divided
1. I no longer generate that annoying text file (i dont even know why it was there in the first place).
1. a little bit of refactoring
