## Task 1

I really dont have any idea what im doing :(

## Task 3

Well, according to how it was explained (granted that I understood correctly), the first and last number of each 6-bit number are the first two bits in the result. Everything between those is the x and y coordinates for the X-box, the value in the corresponding cell is the last 2 bits of the result. Hope this makes sense.

Using the first S-box:
A. 011010 -> 0009
B. 001111 -> 0101
C. 110110 -> 0207
D. 110011 -> 0311


Using the second S-box:
A. 011010 -> 0000
B. 001111 -> 0114
C. 110110 -> 0206
D. 110011 -> 0306
